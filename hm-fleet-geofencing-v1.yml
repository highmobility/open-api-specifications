  title: Fleet Geofencing API 
  description: >-
    The Geofencing API allows fleet operators to define zones and assign them to vehicles in order to get notified once a vehicle enters or exits a zone.
    
    
    In order to use the API endpoints you will need to retrieve an auth token using the [Service Account Token API](/api-references/code-references/service-account/reference/v1/).
securityDefinitions:
  ServiceAccountToken:
    type: apiKey
    name: Authorization
    description: >-
      This is a Bearer token. Service Account Token is a temporary token for
      server to service communication, find out more how to generate one at

        (and optional human-readable name).<br> In order for geofencing to work,
        the _geojson_ needs to represent an _area_ (lines etc. will not produce
        an effect).<br> <br> A created zone is a _prerequisite_ to connecting
        vehicles with "geofencing behaviours" (aka _notifications_).
